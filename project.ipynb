    "In the current experiment, I attempt to measure the N400, an ERP-component usually elicited by an increased load on semantic processing. The N400 is characterized by a negativity typically observable around 400 ms after the occurrence of the stimulus, maximal in amplitude in the central-parietal areas, but otherwise broadly distributed over the scalp. The N400 is sensitive to infrequent as well as contextually unexpected words. Semantic priming (the previous presentation of semantically related words) has been shown to reduce its amplitude. For more details, see [the Wikipedia page for the N400 ERP-component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N400_(neuroscience)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I examine the contextual aspect of N400. I hypothesise that people in general tend to expect men and women to have jobs and demonstrate attitudes that are traditionally masculine or feminine, respectively. Therefore, sentences that communicate information deviating from these standards should elicit the N400 response due to difficulties in contextual processing.\n",

    "Subjects are presented sentences word-by-word on a screen, with the following grammatical structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$The$ $<subject>$ $<adverb>$ $<predicate>$ $<\\textit{possessive gender pronoun}>$ $<object>$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these sentences express traditional relationships between the subject's gender and their professional activities, such as \"*The doctor carefully prepared his tools.*\", while others contain somewhat unusual phenomena, e.g. \"*The engineer tiredly cleaned her glasses.*\" I hypothesize that these latter sentences - due to their surprising gender-related content (e.g. engineering is usually perceived by the general public as a masculine occupation) - elicit an N400 component that differs significantly from the responses potentially elicited by convential sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjects of the experiment are all members of Rajk College for Advanced studies. Their native language is Hungarian, but they are practised English speakers, which is important as the sentences are presented in English. (I couldn't do the experiment in Hungarian due to the lack of gender-specific pronouns.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For stimulus presentation, I use the [`PsychoPy`](https://www.psychopy.org/index.html) package. I record neural activity with the help of the [Muse headband](https://choosemuse.com/) and use the [`muse-lsl`](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl) package to visualize the EEG-recording in real time to adjust the headband and stabilize the signal. The muse headband has 2 frontal and 2 temporal electrodes, which is not ideal to measure the centro-parietally concentrated N400 component, but I hope that its extended nature allows me to catch some of the signal. Nevertheless, due to the simplified technology of this device and the potential noise disrupting the experimental conditions, the current study has its severe limitations."
