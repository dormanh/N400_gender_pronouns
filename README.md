### N400_gender_pronouns

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This project is for the Computer Programming subject at Eötvös Loránd University, Faculty of Psyhology and Education, Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience, 2021 spring semester.

In `project.ipynb` I present an experiment that tests, whether violation of gender-specific stereotypes during sentence processing elicits the N400 ERP-component. See the notebook for more details. `stimulus.json` contains the stimulus used in the experiment, and `function.py` contains some helper functions used during the analysis. The recordings and details of stimulus presentation can be downloaded from [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6gcqbx9vwwb2i28/output.tar.gz?dl=0).
